//This programming exercise is designed to help you practice creating a C++ class for a bank account.
//The exercise involves creating an Account class with various functionalities, 
//including setting and getting the balance, depositing and withdrawing funds,
//and testing the class with a main function.
//First, you would need to complete the "account.h" file before testing it using "lab2exercise1.cpp"    

#include <iostream>
#include "account.h"

int main() {
    // TODO: Create an Account object using the default constructor.
    
    // TODO: Create another Account object with an initial balance of $1000.

    // TODO: Test the 'getBalance' function to retrieve the balance of both accounts and print them.

    // TODO: Deposit $500 into the first account.

    // TODO: Withdraw $200 from the second account.

    // TODO: Test the 'getBalance' function again to check the updated balances and print them.

    // TODO: Set a new balance of $3000 for the first account using the 'setBalance' function.

    // TODO: Test the 'getBalance' function for the first account after setting the new balance.

    // TODO: Test the 'withdraw' function for the second account, attempting to withdraw an amount greater than the balance.

    // TODO: Test the destructor for both accounts.

    return 0;
